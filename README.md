It is time to create a project to help you keep track of all the projects you need to create. 

### Goals

We need an application that allows users to create a series of projects. Each project can have a set of pages where users can keep track of various things.
This project is inteded to be used to learn the concepts around MVC and asynchronous programming.


### Lab 1

The goal for this first lab is to add to projects the concept of a page. For the first page we will focus on being able to create a contact list that is tied to the project.

With each project I want to be able to create groups which I can use to group contacts, tasks, and other various items together. For example see the image below.
